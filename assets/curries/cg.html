    <P>Chicken Ginger
        Before anything let's make one thing clear: If you put julienned ginger on your Chicken Karahi, it is still
        Chicken Karahi. Chicken Ginger is assertively ginger-y, has a generous amount of pepper, and a gravy that is
        richer and more assertive than the cleaner tasting Karahi Chicken or the onion based Chicken Masala.</P>
