    <h1>Mutton Spinach</h1>

    <p>uicy, tender bites of slow-cooked lamb and a rich curry sauce unite to form a delicious Lamb and Spinach Curry
        (Palak Gosht). Made from simple ingredients, this curry is anything but a simpleton and is very popular in
        Pakistan and India. The Piquant Post team makes only the fresh ingredients in our authentic Garam Masala blend.
        Freshly ground spices are key to building complex aroma and flavor and the combination of ingredients makes
        every bite satisfying. Served with fragrant Basmati rice, this is a hearty and easy meal to add to your recipe
        rotation. </p>
