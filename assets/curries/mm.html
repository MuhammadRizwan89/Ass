    <p>Here is an excellent mutton recipe that you can easily make at home. To prepare this easy recipe, firstly, clean and
        wash the mutton pieces. Next, put a large pan over medium flame and melt ghee in it. Once the ghee has melted, add
        cardamom, cloves, black peppercorns, cinnamon stick. Saute these for a minute and add the sliced onions along with
