    <h1>Nargasi kofta</h1>

    <p>n this recipe, I’m taking the traditional Chicken Kofta curry and making it just that extra bit fancier, by
        adding an egg. Not boiled to serve on the side, but I’m putting the egg inside the kofta.

        Doesn’t sound very fancy, but believe me, whenever I serve this everyone thinks the fancy game has been taken up
        a level!

        It doesn’t actually take significantly longer either. Very often kofta curries have eggs boiled and then halved
        and served alongside the curry, so here all we’re doing is boiling the eggs first and then when we’re shaping
        the meatballs, we’re just forming them around the egg. It really isn’t too hard or long, but it sure looks good!
