    <h1>Checken jalfrezi</h1>

    <p>Say hello to this Chicken Jalfrezi recipe – it’s been in the works since a whooping 2015. You could say it’s
        likely one of my longest projects to date – it’s officially six years old and only making it’s debut on the blog
        now!

        The reason why it’s taken this recipe so darn long to see the light of day is this – my husband does not like
        capsicum. And therefore, it just never ended up on our meal rotation, like, ever. So whilst this recipe has been
        in the works for six years, I probably only cooked it six times during that time.</p>
