    <h1>Handi gosht laziz</h1>


    <p>My favourite protein has always been lamb and my love affair with it has only increased after coming to
        Australia. You get the most amazing cuts of meat here and I am trying to befriend the butchers at the Dandenong
        Farmer’s market to learn more about butchery. And for those who live in Melbourne and have not visited this
        market, it is a great place for family and budget shopping. The fresh produce, vibrancy, colours and the market
        mayhem…makes it a true shopping adventure each time. Plus, there are plenty of activities and fun stuff for
        children on the weekends so you can double it up as a fun family outing too.
