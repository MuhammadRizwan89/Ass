    <h1>Usmania special soup</h1>

    <p>Usmania Chinese experiment with different combinations of vegetables based on our customerâ€™s demands. We use
        fresh, healthy vegetables. Aside from that, we add tofu, paneer, or bamboo shoots, among other things. We
        typically serve our vegetable hot and sour soup with green coriander and spring onion greens on top. The soup
        warms the soul and the belly, but it also helps to use up all the tidbits of vegetables lurking in the fridge
        crisper, which is a bonus. It can be served as a starter or appetizer before the main course meal. This soup
        recipe is very delicious, and once we chop the vegetables, we can make it in less than 15-20 minutes.</p>
