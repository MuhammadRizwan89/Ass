    <h1>Beef seek kabab</h1>


    <p> Any party is incomplete without some delicious appetizers to kick start with and there would be no better option
        than some hot, grilled or roasted seekh kebabs. Kebabs made from minced mutton and chicken meat, slathered in a
        bowl of spices and grilled to perfection. Full of juice and flavor, these kebabs are perfect as a starter for an
        amazing dinner party. Served with mint chutney and a side of onion rings and lemon wedges, you won't need
        anything else to start the party!</p>
