    <h1>Bufallo Wings</h1>
    <p>Here at Delish, we look forward to digging into saucy, crispy buffalo wings while cheering on the big game all
        year long. Okay, that might be a bit of an overstatement, but really…a Super Bowl spread isn’t complete without
        a plate (or two) of chicken wings ready to be devoured. To skip the mess (and time commitment) that comes from
        making fried wings, turn to these baked buffalo wings instead. They’re easy to make, and still result in a
        deliciously crispy, saucy, and caramelized wing we can’t get enough of.</p>
